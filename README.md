# Random Menu Generator
This program generates a random list of food or drinks for those who are unsure of what to eat or drink. The menu consists of a list of fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, beverages, and other food items.

## Getting Started
To use this program, simply run the makanan_minuman_random function and specify the number of food or drink items you would like to generate. The function will randomly select items from the menu list and generate a string that lists the items. The first letter of each item will be capitalized.

You can also add or remove items from the menu list if you wish to customize the list of food or drink items.

## Usage
To use the program:

Run the program using the command python random_menu.py in the command line or terminal.
When prompted, answer with y if you would like the program to generate a random list of food or drink items, or answer with n if you do not.
If you answered y, the program will generate a random list of food or drink items and display it.
You can also add or remove items from the menu list by answering with add or remove when prompted.

#### Example Output
Bingung Mau Makan/Minum Apa? (y/n), atau mau nambah menu apa? (add/remove) y
Cobain Makan Atau Minum Ini Deh: Semangka Almond Jus
