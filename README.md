# Random-menu
Random Menu is a Python script that generates a random menu of dishes and assigns them to courses (appetizer, main course, dessert). It uses a CSV file of dishes as input and randomly selects a number of dishes for each course.

# Usage
To use Random Menu, you will need Python 3 and the Pandas library installed. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the script from the command line:

#Copy code
python random_menu.py dishes.csv
Replace dishes.csv with the path to your own CSV file of dishes.
